    <div id="branch">
        Learning how does Branches works, while working for a huge company devs will work in teams of devs on a single project, each one of the groups will work over different features. so they divided into branches, each branch is assigned for a particular feature. 

        Even branches can be published to GitHub as well, but netlify will only deploy codes from the main branch of the repository. so we gotta merge the other branches with the main branch in case to deploy all the source codes of the branches.
